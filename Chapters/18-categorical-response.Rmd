<!-- # Categorical response variable {#categoricalResponse} -->
<!-- So far we have discussed the models, where the response variable was numerical (e.g. weight, sales, price etc). However, there are cases, when we need to predict categorical variables. For example, predicting what colour of t-shirt will be more popular next year or what type of service a group of customers would prefer based on their characteristics. The topic of prediction of categorical variables is huge and includes a large variety of instruments. The interested reader is suggested to learn about the methods in this context from @Faraway2016. -->

<!-- In this chapter, we start with the model with binary response variable, relying on logistic transform, then move to the multinomial model for the response variable in nominal scale with several values (e.g. "red", "green" and "blue", see Section \@ref(scales)), after that - to the model with the response variable in the ordinal scale (e.g. "good", "bad", "awful", see Section \@ref(scales)). -->
