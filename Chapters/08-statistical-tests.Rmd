# Statistical tests {#statisticalTests}


<!-- The group of tests united by the term "Parametric statistical tests" includes those of them that have some distributional assumptions and typically rely on moments of distributions. These tests are typically more powerful than their non-parametrical counterparts, because they rely on more assumptions. In this Section we discuss the most popular tests that are used in practice. -->
