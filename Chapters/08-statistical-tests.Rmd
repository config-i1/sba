# Statistical tests {#statisticalTests}
Having discussed the idea of hypothesis testing, we can now move to the discussion of specific tests. In this chapter, we will start the discussion from the tests for the means of random variables, then move towards the variance and to the comparison of several variables. The tests in this chapter are introduced based on the needs of an analyst. We finish the chapter with a discussion of how to select the appropriate statistical test for your problem.


<!-- The group of tests united by the term "Parametric statistical tests" includes those of them that have some distributional assumptions and typically rely on moments of distributions. These tests are typically more powerful than their non-parametrical counterparts, because they rely on more assumptions. In this Section we discuss the most popular tests that are used in practice. -->
