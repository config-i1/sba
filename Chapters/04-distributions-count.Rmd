# Random variables and count distributions {#countDistributions}
In this Chapter, we will discuss what a random variable is, then move to the discrete probability distributions, discussing their properties, considering several examples of such distributions. We will discuss the following distributions in this chapter: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric and Negative Binomial.
