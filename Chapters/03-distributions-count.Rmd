# Random variables and count distributions {#countDistributions}
In this Chapter, we will focus on discrete probability distributions, discussing their properties, considering several examples of such distributions. We will discuss the following distributions in this chapter: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric and Negative Binomial.

## What is distribution?


<!-- ## Tossing a coin -- Bernouli distribution -->


<!-- ## Outcomes of multiple trials -- Binomial distribution -->


<!-- ## Poisson distribution  -->


<!-- ## Geometric -->


<!-- ## Negative Binomial -->
